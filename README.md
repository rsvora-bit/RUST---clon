## 🏝️ What is Tideland?

**Tideland** is an original procedural first-person survival sandbox running directly in a web browser. The world is generated at runtime and combines exploration, resource gathering, crafting, building, survival systems, weather, persistence and first-person interaction into one continuously evolving project.

The game is built with **TypeScript**, **Three.js**, **Rapier 3D** and **Vite**, while the interface is rendered with a custom DOM-based UI.

Tideland started as an experiment in building a Rust-inspired survival loop for the web, but the goal is not to reproduce Rust feature-for-feature. The project is gradually developing its **own world generation, visual identity, systems and gameplay direction**.

---

## 🎯 Why this project exists

Tideland is both a game and a long-term development project. It is used to experiment with browser game architecture, procedural generation, rendering, physics, performance, UI, gameplay systems and automated testing while continuously turning those experiments into a playable survival game.

The main idea is simple:

> **Build a survival game that feels increasingly like a real standalone game — not just a technical demo running in Three.js.**

---

## 🧭 Project direction

| We want | We do not want |
| --- | --- |
| A coherent survival sandbox | A collection of disconnected tech demos |
| Stable first-person controls | Camera or input behaviour that changes randomly between devices |
| A world worth exploring | Empty procedural terrain with repeated props |
| Strong atmosphere and readable visuals | Graphics that destroy performance for no gameplay benefit |
| Meaningful gathering, crafting and building | Hundreds of systems with no depth |
| Smooth browser performance | Startup stutter hidden inside normal gameplay |
| Clear update history and versioning | Large undocumented changes |
| Automated tests for important systems | Shipping changes without validation |

---

## ⚙️ Current gameplay systems

### 🌍 World
- Procedural island terrain and biomes
- Forests, grass, rocks, resources and coastal detail
- Day/night progression and atmosphere
- Dynamic rain, fog and storms
- Distance culling and quality settings

### 🪓 Survival & interaction
- Harvestable trees, stone, metal, fiber and berries
- Hunger, thirst, stamina and health
- Tools and resource-specific gathering
- Dropped items and world persistence
- Falling-tree depletion animation when a tree is fully harvested

### 🧱 Building & progression
- Building plan with placeable structures
- Placement validation and collision checks
- Doors and persistent structures
- Workbench progression and crafting requirements
- Survival stations and station upgrades

### 🎒 Player & UI
- Inventory and quick belt
- Crafting queue
- First-person hands with animated held tools, equip transitions, sway, sprint pose and inspect
- Configurable FOV and viewmodel FOV
- Frame-rate independent mouse look, separate X/Y sensitivity, auto-run, invert Y and head bob settings
- Render scale, shadows, compass and crosshair settings
- Map, waypoints, diagnostics and developer telemetry

### 💾 Persistence
The browser locally persists worlds, settings, inventory, crafting, structures, doors, drops, depleted resource nodes and survival progression.

---

## 🚀 Current development focus

**v0.4.x** is focused on first-person game feel, movement and viewmodel presentation.

- ✅ Tuned acceleration/deceleration, air control, crouch transitions and landing response
- ✅ Frame-rate independent mouse-look accumulation and burst protection
- ✅ Detailed staged world loading
- ✅ Shader compilation and GPU warm-up before gameplay
- ✅ Falling-tree resource depletion
- ✅ Expanded settings and diagnostics
- ✅ Automated CI validation
- 🔧 GitHub Pages deployment for the new standalone repository
- ✅ Animated hands/tools with swing, recoil, sway, sprint pose and inspect
- ✅ Speed- and surface-aware procedural footsteps

---

## 🗺️ Roadmap

### `v0.2.x` — Foundation & stability
Performance, input, loading, persistence, building reliability, resource behaviour and debugging tools.

### `v0.3.x` — Visual & audio overhaul
Planned work includes improved terrain presentation, vegetation, trees, water, lighting, shadows, weather, particles, hit effects, first-person presentation and a new sound pass.

### Future
- Deeper crafting and progression
- More meaningful landmarks and exploration
- Better building variety
- Improved survival balancing
- More environmental interaction
- Expanded world events and points of interest
- Continued optimization for both Windows and macOS browsers

The roadmap is intentionally flexible. Features are added when they improve the core survival experience rather than simply increasing the feature count.

## 🧰 Technology

```text
TypeScript
├── Three.js       → WebGL rendering and scene management
├── Rapier 3D      → physics and collision
├── Vite           → development server and production build
├── Vitest         → unit/integration validation
└── Playwright     → browser gameplay QA
```

The project intentionally stays close to the underlying browser and rendering stack instead of using a large game engine. This keeps the architecture visible and makes rendering, input, simulation and performance systems directly controllable.

---

## 📦 Run locally

Requirements: a current Node.js installation and npm.

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Production validation:

```bash
npm test
npm run build
```

Browser gameplay QA:

```bash
npm run test:browser
```

---

## 🧪 Development workflow

Changes should remain playable and validated before being treated as a finished update.

```text
feature / fix
     ↓
local or branch validation
     ↓
unit tests + production build
     ↓
merge to main
     ↓
GitHub Actions CI
     ↓
GitHub Pages test build
```

The repository includes automated GitHub Actions CI so important regressions are visible immediately after changes reach GitHub.

## 📜 Release history

| Version | Focus |
| --- | --- |
| `v0.2.3` | Detailed loading, GPU warm-up and falling trees |
| `v0.2.2` | Mouse input stability and loading warm-up |
| `v0.2.1` | Cross-device camera and expanded settings |
| `v0.2.0` | Local/GitHub reconciliation, building and survival polish |
| `v0.1.0` | Initial early-access survival foundation |

Full release notes are maintained in **[CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md)** and are also available from the in-game **HISTORY** menu.

Implementation and QA notes are stored in **[POLISH-STATUS.md](./POLISH-STATUS.md)**.

## 🏫 Repository history

Tideland was previously developed inside a larger school programming repository. That copy is intentionally kept as a stable historical snapshot:

**[rsvora-bit/it3b_prog_/Projekty/Tideland](https://github.com/rsvora-bit/it3b_prog_/tree/main/Projekty/Tideland)**

Starting with `v0.2.3`, **this repository is the canonical source for all new Tideland development**.

---

## 🌱 Development philosophy

Tideland is still early in development. Systems may be redesigned when there is a clear gameplay, stability or performance reason to do so.

Priorities are:

1. **Controls must feel correct.**
2. **The game must remain performant.**
3. **New systems should have a purpose.**
4. **Visual improvements should strengthen atmosphere without destroying FPS.**
5. **Major changes should be testable, documented and reversible.**
